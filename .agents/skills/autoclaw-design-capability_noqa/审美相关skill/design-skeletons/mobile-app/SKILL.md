# Mobile App Skill

Produce a single mobile-app screen mockup that defaults to standard phone resolution, with rounded corners, no device frame, and responsive behavior for tablet and desktop preview widths.

## Resource map

```
mobile-app/
├── SKILL.md                ← you're reading this
├── assets/
│   └── template.html       ← seed: screen container + primitives (READ FIRST)
└── references/
    ├── layouts.md          ← 6 screen archetypes (Feed / Detail / Onboarding / Profile / Checkout / Focus)
    └── checklist.md        ← P0/P1/P2 self-review
```

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Pre-flight

1. **Read `assets/template.html`** end-to-end through the `<style>` block. The screen container, status bar, home indicator, and tab bar are already drawn — do not re-implement them.
2. **Read `references/layouts.md`** so you know which 6 archetypes exist.
3. **Read the active DESIGN.md** — map its tokens to the six `:root` variables in the seed.

### Step 1 — Copy the seed

Copy `assets/template.html` to the project root as `index.html`. Replace the six `:root` variables with the active design system's tokens. Replace the page `<title>`.

### Step 2 — Pick exactly one archetype

| Brief language | Use |
|---|---|
| feed, inbox, timeline, list, messages, notifications | A — Feed |
| article, post, item, recipe, song, product, song detail | B — Detail |
| sign-up, welcome, intro, walkthrough, tour | C — Onboarding |
| profile, account, user page, someone's bio | D — Profile |
| checkout, payment, order, form, settings step | E — Checkout |
| timer, map, dashboard widget, single big number | F — Focus / hero card |

A mobile screen does **one job**. If the brief seems to combine two, ship one screen and offer the other as a follow-up.

### Step 3 — Paste and fill

Copy the archetype block from `layouts.md` into `<main class="content">`, replacing the placeholder card. Fill bracketed text with real, specific copy from the brief. **Drop the `<nav class="tabbar">` block entirely** for archetypes that don't show one (B, C, E).

### Step 4 — Self-check

Run through `references/checklist.md`. Pay extra attention to:
- Screen has rounded corners (44px)
- Tap targets ≥ 44px
- One accent, used ≤ 2× on the screen
- Display headings still use `var(--font-display)` (serif)

### Step 5 — Emit the artifact

```
<artifact identifier="mobile-slug" type="text/html" title="Mobile — Screen Name">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```

One sentence before describing what's there. Stop after `</artifact>`.

## Hard rules

- **No device frame.** No iPhone bezel, no Dynamic Island, no metallic rails. The screen itself has 44px rounded corners — that's enough to read as "phone".
- **Default phone resolution.** Screen is authored at 390×844 (iPhone 14/15 logical), but the HTML must also adapt when the host switches to tablet or desktop viewport.
- **No permanently fixed outer shell.** You may use 390×844 as the mobile authoring viewport, but the root app surface must have responsive constraints (`width: min(...)`, `height: min(...)`, media queries, or equivalent) so it does not break at 834×1112 or 1440×900.
- **Single screen, single job.** No multi-tab tours, no spliced flows.
- **Accent budget = 2.** One active tab + one primary action is the default.
- **Numerics in mono** via `.num` class.
- **Display in serif** via `var(--font-display)`.
- **No external images** — use `.ph-img` placeholders.
- **No emoji anywhere in the rendered screen.** Not as icons, not as avatars, not as product images. Use `.ph-img` for image placeholders and inline SVG for icons.
